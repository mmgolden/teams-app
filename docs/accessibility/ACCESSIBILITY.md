# Accessibility

Some of the best practices I used for accessibility was:

- Used semantic HTML. Ex. Structural HTML tags such as header, nav, and main
- Used labels with form inputs and clicking on a label focuses the input
- App can be navigated with a keyboard
- Used aria-labels when buttons do not have any text information. Ex. The account menu button in the navbar
- Added alt attributes to images
- Ensured that the heading (H1, H2, H3) hierarchy was logical

I used the [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool to point out any errors. The only errors that I had were related to contrast errors.
